# forecast_time_series_1

For every time series data, for example a product sales history, we can use time series prediction analysis to forecast the value in the future. In this analyis, I studied the 
sales history of the tire product from the website (GoodTires.com), and predict the future sales. Two models was used to perform the prediction, which are 3-week moving average
model and single exponential smoothing model. Each model demonstrates its strength for predicting the sales.
